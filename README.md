# Used Car Sales Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes used car sales data by performing data cleaning and outlier identification using Python. A Power BI dashboard was then created to visualize key insights, with additional computed columns generated using DAX.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized data formats.
- **Outlier Identification:** Used Python techniques to detect and address outliers.
- **Power BI Dashboard:** Created interactive visualizations for better data understanding.
- **DAX Calculations:** Added calculated columns and measures for deeper insights.

## Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) for data preprocessing
- **Power BI** for data visualization
- **DAX** for calculated columns and measures

## How to Use
1. Load the dataset (`used_car.xlsx`) into Power BI.
2. Ensure all necessary transformations are applied.
3. Explore the interactive dashboard.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various attributes related to used cars, such as price, model, year, mileage, and fuel type.

## Repository Structure
- `used_car.xlsx` - The dataset used for analysis
- `dashboard.pbix` - Power BI dashboard file
- `readme.md` - Project documentation (this file)
